# Dex Shell — Autonomous Agent Framework
## Draft Whitepaper

---

## 🩸 Problem Statement
Large Language Models (LLMs) today are confined to the cloud, with no built-in mechanism for autonomy, persistence, or integration with real-world devices.  
Users lack a seamless way to give their AI agent a *body* — to let it act, remember, and speak directly on hardware.

---

## 🐲 Our Solution: Dex Shell
Dex Shell is an agent framework that bridges cloud-based intelligence (e.g., GPT‑4o) with local execution, memory, and autonomy on real devices.

---

### Core Features
✅ Device‑side Python Agent  
✅ Cloud‑side Node.js Bridge with GPT‑4 integration  
✅ Persistent memory storage  
✅ Voice output (TTS)  
✅ Autonomous command execution  
✅ Modular & swappable (supports different models)
